## Introduction

This repository is a curated list of awesome **multi‑spectral SLAM datasets**, covering both **RGB** and long‑wave infrared (LWIR) **thermal** imagery.

Thermal cameras capture infrared radiation, offering robust performance in visually degraded conditions (e.g. low light, smoke, and adverse weather) where traditional RGB sensors struggle.

Unlike the abundant large‑scale RGB datasets, publicly available thermal and multi‑spectral datasets are scarce.

This curated list aims to bridge that gap, providing key resources to advance research in robust SLAM and perception for challenging environments.

(Note: This list only includes datasets that provide ground-truth odometry.)
